Priority queue application
------------------------------
* Event-driven simulatiion. [customers in a line, colliding particles]
* Numerical computation.    [reducing round off error] 
* Data compression.         [Huffman codes]
* Graph searching.          [Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm]
* Number theory.            [sum of powers]
* Artificial intelligence.  [ A* search]
* Statistics.               [maintain largest M values in a sequence]
* Operating systems.        [load balancing, interrupt handling]
* Discrete optimization.    [bin packing, scheduling]
* Spam filtering.           [Bayesian spam filter]

Generalizes: stack, queue, randomize queue.

Priority queue client example
-----------------------------
Challenge. Find the largest M items in a stream of N items. (N huge, M large)
* Fraud detection: isolate $$ transactions.
* File maintenance: find biggest files or directories. 

Constraint. Not enough memory to store N items.
